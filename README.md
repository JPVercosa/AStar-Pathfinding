# AStar-Pathfinding

An python script that simulates and show the working progress of a A* pathfinder algortihm. 

Done with PyGame.

In this project you can set up a Grid, and choose two points. The first one will be the initial point and the second one will be the end point.

After that you can draw on the grid system barriers, creating different paths, that will be analyzed by the algortihm.

To run the algorithm you just need to press SPACE after finishing drawing the barriers.

After pressing SPACE, you will see the A* Path Finding algorithm trying to find the shortest path between the initial point and the end point.
